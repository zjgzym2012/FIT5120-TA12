<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Occupational Lung Diseases
**Occupational exposure** contributes substantially to the burden of lung disease in Australia. There are many occupations that have harmful impacts on the lungs of the people. There is a **lack of awareness** among the people about the occupations or elements which are risky for them. 

We, **Respiratory Repairers** aim to make a difference in the lives of innocent people working in the industries who are exposed to **harmful elements** daily, because if the lungs are damaged once, it may be permanently impossible to recover.

This is the IE project of TA12 in 2020, S2. The theme of the project is Lung health - Help me breath. Project name is Breathe And Believe.

## Team Introduction
We together as a team from different majors of study are working together for a capstone project in this unit. It gives all of us a chance to retain whatever we have been learning throughout for major to apply it now so that it could be useful once we go into the market to pursue our professional career. Some of our team strengths are critical thinking, attention to detail, good at handling pressure, and quick at learning new things.

We as a team now are working on "Occupational Lung Diseases" topic under "My-Health" as a main topic.
