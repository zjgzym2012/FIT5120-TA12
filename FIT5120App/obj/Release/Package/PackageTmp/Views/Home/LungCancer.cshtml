                        <p class="pera-bottom mb-30">
                            It is caused when cells grow in an abnormal way in one or both the lungs.
                            At the work-place when an individual gets exposed to the carcinogenic(cancer-causing) agents for a longer-duration they are more triggered to get affected by the lung cancer because carcinogenesis is a complex, multifactorial process where genetic and environmental factors can play an inter-related role that can lead to uncontrolled cell growth.
