                <h2><strong>What are Occupational Lung Diseases ?</strong> </h2>
                <p>
                    Occupational Lung Diseases (or) work-related lung diseases have been caused (or) made worse by the materials a person gets exposed to within their workplace. They are caused by long-term exposure to certain irritants that are present in the materials which are breadthened into the lungs. These kind of OLDs sometimes have lasting effects even after the exposure ends.
