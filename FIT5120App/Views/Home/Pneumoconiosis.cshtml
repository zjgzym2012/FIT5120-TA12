                            Pneumoconiosis is defined as a tissue reaction in the lungs that occurs by inhaling dust and accumulating in the lungs.

                        <p class="pera-top mb-40">How is it caused?</p>
                        <p class="pera-bottom mb-30">

                            In general, when dust is absorbed through the respiratory tract, most of the dust is discharged to the outside through the ciliary movements of the bronchi, but some dust cannot escape and accumulates in the lungs, causing inflammation, and fibrosis occurs due to a continuous inflammatory reaction.

                        <p class="pera-bottom mb-30">
                            Not all types of dust cause pneumoconiosis, there are special types of dust that cause pneumoconiosis.
