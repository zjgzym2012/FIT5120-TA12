                            Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a disease in which persistent airflow and respiratory symptoms are caused by abnormalities in the airways and alveoli caused by exposure to harmful particles or gases.
                        </p>

                        <p class="pera-top mb-40">How is it caused?</p>
                        <p class="pera-bottom mb-30">
                           In general, smoking is known as the strongest trigger, and other environmental and occupational factors, infection, family history, and genetic factors are known as triggers. In general, about 15% of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases are caused by occupational causes.

                        </p>

                        <p class="pera-bottom mb-30">
                            Because smoking is the strongest trigger, occupational causes are easy to underestimate. However, grain dust and silica are clearly identified occupational factors, and indirect smoking, cotton dust, wood dust, talc, and metals are also known to be the main causes of occupational chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
