                            It is an interstitial lung disease or a type of chronic pneumoconiosis or fibrosis which is caused due to inhalation of silica dust that is found in various types of rocks and soils.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How is it caused?</h3>
                        <p class="pera-bottom mb-30">

                            When people breathe silica dust which is obtained from mineral silica, then they inhale tiny particles of silica. These respirable tiny particles of silica penetrate into the deeper parts of lungs. A long time exposure by the workers lead to high inhaling of silica particles which can cause SIlicosis.
